Below are some of the words that stylize each author based on their frequency within the authors's works and also their exclusivity to
teir literature. The words are listed next to figures that illustrate this, one representing the frequency each author used a word,
while the other statistic represents the number of times a word in one author's vocabulary was used by the other two. Finally,
a ratio divides the two measurements to give a quick way to dtermine a word's worthiness to be a part of our feature list.
